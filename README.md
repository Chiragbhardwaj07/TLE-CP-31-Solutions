# TLE Eliminators CP Sheet Solutions

Welcome to my repository of solutions to the [TLE Eliminators CP Sheet](https://www.tle-eliminators.com/cp-sheet)!

## 📌 About

This repository contains my personal solutions to problems from the TLE Eliminators Competitive Programming Sheet. The sheet categorizes problems by difficulty ratings, starting from 800 and going up.

Currently, I have uploaded solutions for problems up to **900** rating, and I will continue to add more as I solve higher-rated problems.

The aim of this repository is to help fellow competitive programmers by providing reference implementations, approaches, and clean code structure.

## 📁 Structure

The solutions are organized by rating folders:
```
📂 800/
📂 900/
...more coming soon!
```

Each folder contains problem solutions with proper filenames (usually problem names or IDs) and comments wherever necessary.

## 💻 Languages Used

- C++ (Primary)
- May add Python in future

## 🧠 How to Use

1. Browse through the rating folders.
2. Open the file of the problem you're interested in.
3. Read the approach, logic, and implementation.
4. Use it only for reference or after giving the problem an honest try!
